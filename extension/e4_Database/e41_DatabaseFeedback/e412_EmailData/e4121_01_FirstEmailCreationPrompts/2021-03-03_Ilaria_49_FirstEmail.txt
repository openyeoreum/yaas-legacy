[Age] 10-15
[Happiness Index] 8
[Content] Same as before. I was good in school and had good friends. I entered the conservatorium and became best friend with a girl and her sister and we were enjoying ourselves a lot all toghether with my sister too. This friendship let me overcome the sad experience of loosing a previous friend who got probably (I have always thought) upset but my admission to the conservatory of music while she was not. My parents got a house in the countryside and we loved it. We had lots of friends there and we were having lots of trips with the motorbikes up in the mountains. There was a sense of freedom! In those same years I started to be more conscious about problems in my parents relationship. They have always loved each other deeply, but used to fight sometimes and that gave me much sadness. Mainly I was deeply saddened by seeing my mum unfulfilled and unhappy. Another difficult passage was when I decided to leave the consevatorium when moving from junior secondary school to middle secondary school. I was sure studying piano was not for me. But I felt I was failing my mum's expectations. She never said so... it was only my impression. But I did feel like that.

[Content] Same as before. School was good. Friends were good. Again... my parents incomprehensions and my mum's unsatisfaction were probably the only true problem for me.  I had some difficulties when I needed to decide which university to attend. I was very undecided... thought about Uni just because I was granted free entrance to it because of my high scores in finishing school. I actually had never thought about my future. I decided to enrol in Law because I loved it at school. I was interested also in architecture but I was told it was too expensive and decided not to pursue that path. For the rest life was good. Always best marks, good friends, loving and caring parents.... I really had all I wanted.I had started studying the saxophone and I was playing in the philarmonic and in a small pop-rock band in the countryside.. at 19 I also met my now husband!!!
