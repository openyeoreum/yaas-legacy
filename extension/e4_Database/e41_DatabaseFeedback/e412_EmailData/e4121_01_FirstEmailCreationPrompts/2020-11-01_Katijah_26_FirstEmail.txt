Estimated Nationality: 

[Age] 0-3
[Happiness Index] 4
[Content] I had a lot of attention from my family and many toys and books, being the first child. I was also satisfied in my own company and imagination. I had a lot of special, memorable moments. Even though I know now there was a lot of financial struggle and toxic, unstable behaviour from my parents, I don't remember it. My sister was born and that felt exciting. I was young and had known no other life so I was content.
[Purpose] 부모님의 재정적 어려움과 불안정한 행동에 대한 기억이 없던 시기로, 어린 시절의 순수한 행복을 되찾고자 함
[Reason] 현재의 인식과 달리 어린 시절에는 가족의 어려움에 대한 인지가 부족했기 때문
[Author's Questions to be solved] 어떻게 하면 어린 시절의 순수한 행복을 다시 느낄 수 있을까요?

[Age] 3-6
[Happiness Index] 6
[Content] I started attending school which I really enjoyed and performed well at; I was able to thrive in my new independence. I was polite and made friends easily. I felt very validated and competent; I had many memorable, positive experiences with my teachers who had a lot of praise for me. My parents also expressed they were proud of me. I started to acknowledge the negative behaviour at home more, especially when my parents made me promise not to tell the teachers or students at school. Sometimes my parents would use my gift money for household bills; I felt guilty if I didn't comply even though I didn't always get the money back. The police would visit often, especially in the evenings and my dad stopped living with us for a period of time. My parents disrespected each other on a daily basis; the home was a volatile environment and I started preferring to be at school or playing outside with friends.
[Purpose] 괴롭힘과 경제적 차이에 대한 대처 및 극복 방법을 찾고자 함
[Reason] 사회적 상호작용에서의 어려움과 가정 내 재정적 문제의 외부화
[Author's Questions to be solved] 어떻게 하면 괴롭힘을 극복하고 자신감을 회복할 수 있을까요?

[Age] 6-9
[Happiness Index] 2
[Content] I was bullied at school and by older kids on my street. Financial differences between myself and friends at school became more apparent and often I felt shame. My studious nature wasn't always perceived so positively by the other students and I became both more and less content at school for different reasons. Coping with the volatile environment was hard and I felt incredibly invalidated and became passive, compliant and sensitive. I felt less appreciated for the person I was and highly criticised very often.
[Purpose] 정서적 지지 부족과 재정적 부담에 대한 해결책을 찾고자 함
[Reason] 가족 구성원으로부터의 지지 부족과 경제적 자립에 대한 압박
[Author's Questions to be solved] 어떻게 하면 정서적 지지를 찾고 재정적 부담을 줄일 수 있을까요?

[Age] 9-12
[Happiness Index] 2
[Content] I started having sexual feelings and had no one to confide in. I felt lonely and mostly preoccupied myself with creative hobbies: reading and writing fiction and playing the piano. My sister and I would fight often but we still had many fun moments hanging out with our cousins also. My grandparents home was not my idea of homely but always had lots of yummy food. Night terrors, anxieties, sleep walking and sleep talking became a bigger issue but it was unaddressed by my family. During the time my dad didn't live with us, my mother would wake both my sister and I up during late hours to visit drug dealers. I started to walk myself to school but felt angry and worried that often my sister would miss out on attending because our mother failed to wake up in the morning or get them ready.
[Purpose] 현재의 혼란과 방황, 절망감을 해소하고 내면의 평화를 찾고자 함
[Reason] 외부적 성공에도 불구하고 내면적 불만족과 자기 정체성에 대한 혼란
[Author's Questions to be solved] 외적인 성공에도 불구하고 왜 내면적으로 만족하지 못하는 걸까요?
