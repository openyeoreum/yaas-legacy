This is the {22: royal road->왕도} to {23: self-control->자기 통제} and true concentration of {24: thought->생각}. Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his {25: purpose->목적} (as he necessarily must until {26: weakness->약점} is overcome), the {27: strength->힘} of {28: character->인격} gained will be the measure of his true success, and this will form a new starting-point for future {29: power->힘} and triumph.\n\nThose who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great {30: purpose->목적} should fix the {31: thoughts->생각} upon the faultless perfor{32: man->인간}ce of their {33: duty->의무}, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in this way can the {34: thoughts->생각} be gathered and focussed, and {35: resolution->결심} and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which may not be accomplished.\n\nThe weakest {36: soul->영혼}, knowing its own {37: weakness->약점}, and believing this {38: truth->진리} that {39: strength->힘} can only be developed by {40: effort->노력} and practice, will, thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, and, adding {41: effort->노력} to {42: effort->노력}, patience to patience, and {43: strength->힘} to {44: strength->힘}, will never cease to develop, and will at last grow divinely strong.\n\nAs the physically weak {45: man->인간} can make himself strong by careful and patient training, so the {46: man->인간} of weak {47: thoughts->생각} can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.\n\nTo put away {48: aimlessness->목적 부재} and {49: weakness->약점}, and to begin to think with {50: purpose->목적}, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all {51: condition->상태}s serve them, and who think strongly, attempt {52: fear->두려움}lessly, and accomplish masterfully.\n\nHaving conceived of his {53: purpose->목적}, a {54: man->인간} should mentally mark out a straight pathway to its {55: achievement->성취}, looking neither to the right nor the left. Doubts and {56: fear->두려움}s should be rigorously excluded; they are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of {57: effort->노력}, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless. Thoughts of {58: doubt->의심} and {59: fear->두려움} never accomplished anything, and never can. They always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, {60: power->힘} to do, and all strong {61: thoughts->생각} cease when {62: doubt->의심} and {63: fear->두려움} creep in.\n\nThe will to do springs from the {64: knowledge->지식} that we can do. Doubt and {65: fear->두려움} are the great enemies of {66: knowledge->지식}, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.\n\nHe who has conquered {67: doubt->의심} and {68: fear->두려움} has conquered failure. His every {69: thought->생각} is allied with {70: power->힘}, and all difficulties are bravely met and wisely overcome. His {71: purpose->목적}s are seasonably planted, and they bloom and bring forth fruit, which does not fall prematurely to the ground.\n\nThought allied {72: fear->두려움}lessly to {73: purpose->목적} becomes creative force: he who knows this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering {74: thoughts->생각} and fluctuating sensations; he who does this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his mental {75: power->힘}s.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
