[Content] I can't really remeber this age range especially the earlier time however I'm assuming it was bad due to the problems I've had all my life and the continuing difficult relationship with parents. My mum had difficulty controlling her moods and so I'm assuming she didn't handle me well at these ages as they are difficult/tiring ages for anyone to deal with even if they are stable. Also my younger sister was born when I was just 19months old so I assume she had even more difficulty handling that. Also we moved house a lot which will have been unsettling.

[Content] Parents got back together then split up again. Very confusing. When they were together the fought a lot. Home was not safe, school was also not safe. I was quiet and awkward, didn't have many friends when younger that gradually  turned into more severe bullying as I got older. Started secondary school. Had another dog which I loved, mum had this one put down when only 1 year old as she had medical problems and we couldn't afford the vets. We were not very well off as a single parent family, was also bullied for being poor. I felt like I was more like my Dad but he wasn't there anymore. A constant feeling of not fitting in anywhere.

[Age] 12-16
[Happiness Index] -10
[Content] I got into religion for a while in an attempt to fit in with my family. I really believed it for a while but that was stressful as it was very dogmatic and I lived with a constant fear that I would commit and unforgivable sin and be banished to hell. I loved school for learning but not for classmates, was bullied and rejected by the few friends I had, for a while I had no one and wandered the school aimlessly during breaks as I had no one to hang out with. I did well academically but this only served to further alienate my peers and I was bullied for being a christian. Tensions between me and my mum got much worse as I moved into teenage years and she constantly threatened to throw me out to go live my dad. A friend of the family commit suicide in our living room while staying with us a few months before I took my GCSE's.

[Happiness Index] -8
[Content] I did well academically getting good results for GCSE's and A-levels. I rejected christianity and started hanging out with my friends and doing what normal older teenagers do. This gave me a sense of belonging with them but things at home were now really bad with my mum and this came to a head one day when she discovered a condom in my jeans and went crazy. I left for University to study physics, things got better away from home and I found more friends at university however I was tortured with the sence that I had chosen the wrong path with my choice of subjects and that I was truely an artist not a scientist. I felt that I'd not been able to make choice that where true to myself and this has been a continuing theme for the rest of my life.
