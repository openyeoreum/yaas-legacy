Just as a photograph is a fake that captures a scene of the world as it is, the photographs in a person's mind are also fake. It is already a past that has passed, but it is only stored in my mind.\n\n(Subtraction Meditation)\nWhen people think of 'meditation', they often think of calming the breath or mind.\nSubtraction meditation is a meditation that discards the things inside me, and the mind actually becomes empty.\nJust as when sand settles in muddy water, the water looks clear at that moment, but it becomes dirty again when shaken, the mind is the same.\nJust as water and soil must be completely scooped out and discarded to be truly clean, and the container must be emptied to hold clean new water, discarding everything inside me allows me to regain my true nature, which is my true self.\n\n(Effects of Subtraction Meditation)\nAs you discard the photos stored in your mind like this, your mind becomes cleaner.\nAs the original mind is revealed, you become aware of your true self.\nAs you empty your mind, your daily life changes. When you completely break free from your own mind, you can achieve human completion.\n\n- You no longer dwell on your past and things that have passed.\n- You can objectively look at yourself and continuously grow.\n- Dusty thoughts, distractions, and negative minds disappear.\n- Your mind is where your body is, so you focus only on what you are doing now.\n- When stress disappears, your body becomes healthy.\n- The size of your mind grows, giving you the room to consider the other person's perspective.\n- You don't get dragged by emotions, so you don't lash out in anger and then regret it.\n\n(Mind Patterns)\nResilient Type: There are ups and downs, but with good resilience, it gradually finds stability.\nControlled Type: Usually stable, but greater growth is expected through the utilization of latent abilities.\nExpressive Type: Engages in active activities but needs to seek stability by considering the surrounding situation.\nLatent Type: Currently slow in demonstrating abilities, but has the potential for great achievements in the future."
