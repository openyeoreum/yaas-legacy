[Content] I was 1 of 3 siblings born at the end of the family line who were all born a year apart.  My older brother was severely mentally retarded.  Apparently he was pretty rough with me, I don't remember.  My mother had 4 other children who were older and all close in age.  She was always exhausted but so hard working and doing her best.  
[Purpose] 가정 내에서의 안정적인 애착 형성과 정서적 안정감

[Age] 6-12
[Happiness Index] 4
[Content] When I was 6 my down syndrome brother was put into a state facility and I was very confused and sad.  I didn't understand and didn't know about it until it happened.  He was always bruised and battered when we would go see him.  I was very much the one who made faces at people who stared, etc.  During this time I was in first grade at Catholic school.  I loved reading but I don't think I enjoyed school except recess.  Our classes were huge and the nuns were strict.  2nd grade we had a wonderful happy nun who was young and sang and played guitar.  3rd grade I had a horrible, miserable mean nun who hated me.  I was a tomboy so things weren't always easy relating to girls, etc.  I do remember one time my friends in the neighborhood shunned me as their mothers had said I was a tomboy.  I read alone a lot, looked up at airplanes hoping to be somewhere else.  My life was full of adventures with my father; waterskiing, sailing, snowskiing.  I loved my time with him and he loved having a tomboy.  He died when I was 12.

[Content] My sister and I didn't really have much support with our father's death.  my mother was overwhelmed and went to church to pray to get through.  We didn't talk much about it.  I changed from my catholic school to junior high at public and had no friends and was very brainwashed about abortion, etc.  i didn't fit in but I was a good student and in music and was a cheerleader.  I didn't feel like I understood how to be happy.  I started drinking in high school with the couple of misfit friends I met and we had lots of fun but my grades slipped a tiny bit, mostly my motivation slipped.  I didn't see the point of college though I was national merit scholar.  I did lots of sports, played in the bands and acted tough.  I didn't have much boys interested in me.  I think I was pretty quiet.

[Content] I went to college to study pre-law but soon figured out I didn't have the drive or discipline for prelaw.  I liked partying and didn't really want to be there.  I met great friends and had lots of fun, rollerbladed everywhere, loved my theater, anthropology and international studies classes but didn't go all the time, graduated low GPA.  Then I took off for Colorado to be a ski bum.  which put me up to an 8 I think.  8 from 21 to 24.
