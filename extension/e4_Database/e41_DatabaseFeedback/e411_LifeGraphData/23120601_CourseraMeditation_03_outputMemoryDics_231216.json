This is when I started to gain weight, began to play outside less often, and watched a lot of TV—cartoons and documentaries that I could only watch when I had the TV to myself. I also discovered music; I was given a Discman which became a great ally, spending hours listening to music, mainly three albums: one by José José, another by Napoleón, and the last by Hombres G.

I wasn't the best but I was good, I had 3 fights at events, winning 2 of them, and I still keep my trophies. I was proud of how strong I could punch and got really into it, there were days when I would train up to 3 hours. Also, because of the sport, I lost weight, looking back at those photos, I think that was the time when I was the thinnest I've been since I was 6, but I still felt fat, I remember that. During this period, I also remember that was when I discovered Rap, which would be the genre I listened to exclusively for years, I was fascinated that it didn't talk about what popular songs always talked about, love or heartbreak, this genre was different and that caught me. During this time I had my second girlfriend, Monse, I was very much in love, but everything ended a month and a half later when I found out that she was seeing someone else at the same time as me, and I chose to end the relationship after confronting the facts."

I gradually felt more confident again about my intelligence, engineering was really my thing, I always loved mathematics, and seeing them at such complex levels and realizing that I found them much easier to understand than many of my classmates brought me a lot of satisfaction and I liked that they came to me so I could explain what they didn't understand.

I finished university, but I still needed to do my service and internships, I entered a company in the last month of university where I did my internships, I liked what the company was about, it was in the area of development and research, something very much in line with what I thought would be my ideal job. I lasted a year there, after finishing my internships they hired me. But there was a design and manufacturing error in a project that led to most of us workers being fired. I no longer had the school that validated me as someone excellent, it was and still is difficult to continue considering myself excellent without that validation because most of my life or a large part of it I was valued for my grades and my intelligence, it was the only thing I felt I was good at. I tried to make changes in my life at that time, that's when I went to a nutritionist, everything was going well, I lost weight very quickly, but it didn't help me feel better about myself, and even worse when the weight loss began to slow down and became more difficult I also ended up leaving that.

Although I wasn't exactly working as an engineer, that experience was very useful. I stayed with him for two years until earlier this year when they went several months without work. That's when I entered where I currently work as a supervisor. The job isn't bad but I don't like it because there isn't much to think about. That part bores and displeases me. To feel comfortable I really need to be drawing and thinking, otherwise, I get bored and find it tedious, although for the same reason I have been getting more involved with the technical part and maintenance, which also adds to my experience. I tried to continue going to concerts but the job was very demanding. I kept reading since I spent a lot of time in transport, in these years I could say that I have only lived to work, I feel like a machine.
